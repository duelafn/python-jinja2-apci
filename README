Two simple jinja2 extensions.

raise
-----

Raise a TemplateRuntimeError with the given error message.

Example:

    {% if x >= 3 %}{% raise "x must be less than 3" %}{% endif %}


require
-------

The require statement will include a template only if it has not been
previously required. That can be used to include subroutines and similar
structures which should only be included once.

Example:

    {% require "myfile.tmpl" %}
