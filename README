Two simple jinja2 extensions.

raise
-----

Raise a TemplateRuntimeError with the given error message.

Example:

    {% if x >= 3 %}{% raise "x must be less than 3" %}{% endif %}


require
-------

The `require` statement will `include` a template only if it has not been
previously required (aka, "include once"). Unlike the jinja `import`
statement, `require` allows the included template to contain content, not
just macros. We use this for code generation where we wish to require
utility functions, but there are likely other use cases as well.

Example:

    {% require "util_lib.tmpl" %}
